Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.
### 1. List your processes
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

### 4. To infinity and beyond

### 5. Kill me now
We killed our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
### 7. Highlander
Write a Bash script that displays:
* To infinity and beyond indefinitely
* With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
* I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal

Make a copy of your 6-kill_me_now_made_easy script, name it
67-kill_me_now_made_easy, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.
### 8. Beheaded process 
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.
